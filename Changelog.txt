Voreen Changelog
----------------

2008-11-14: Snapshot r3 (voreen-5112)
-------------------------------------
    * New SingleVolumeRaycaster, a modular default renderer:
      o compositing modes: DVR, MIP, isosurface, first-hit point, first-hit normal
      o shading: none, Phong (several variants), toon shading
      o gradient calculation: forward/central differences, filtered
      o supports different compositing modes on its three output ports
      o see network "standard.vnw" for an example
    * Multiplanar slice renderer, see network "multiplanar.vnw".
    * Example network for clipping widgets with two renderers in "clipping.vnw".
    * Simple example programm for using Voreen with GLUT in "apps/glutexample"
      (also see the tutorial on http://www.voreen.org).

    * User interface:
      o dock/undock the preview window by double clicking (VoreenVE)
      o improvements for editing multiple transfer functions
      o load networks with drag and drop (VoreenVE)
      o save state of toolbar and dock widgets (VoreenVE)
      o information about loaded data sets is serialized into the .vnw file
      o more command line parameters for voreenve and voreendev

    * Rendering / volume handling :
      o correct rendering when camera enters the volume
      o hardware volumes (OpenGL textures) are now generated implicitly when
        accessing getVolumeGL()
      o automatic downsampling of volume texture if it is larger than GPU memory
        (available memory must be specified in VolumeGL::setAvailableGpuMemory())
      o OpenGL state is checked after every process() call in
        NetworkEvaluator.

    * More detailed logging of system information, also written to a log file by
      default (you may need to add "DEFINES += VRN_ADD_FILE_LOGGER" to your
      "config.txt" file).
    * Renamed TransFuncIntensityKeys -> TransFuncIntensity.
    * Old "rptgui" application renamed to "voreenve".

    * Various bugfixes and cleanups:
      o fixed DICOM loading
      o do not link with unused ILUT lib (from DevIL image library).
      o texture container widget was showing junk debug messages
      o invalid GL_BLEND and glClearColor state changes
      o automatic registration for Processors
      o serialization of Processor::getName()
      o no more warnings with gcc
      o serialization of BackgroundProcessor in voreendev
      o adapt to coding guidelines
