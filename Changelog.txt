Voreen Changelog
----------------

2009-02-13: Snapshot r13 (voreen-5688)
--------------------------------------
  
    * Redesigned GUI for VoreenVE, using multiple tool windows instead of dock
      widgets, work in progress
 
    * Added network for labeling processor, use with NCAT example data set from
	  the voreen.org website (requires FreeType activated in config.txt):
      o load network 'labeling.vnw'
      o load data sets 'ncat_phantom_medium.dat' and 'ncat_phantom_segmentation.dat'
      o attach 'ncat_phantom_medium.dat' to left VolumeSetSource processor
      o attach 'ncat_phantom_segmentation.dat' to right VolumeSetSource processor
      o press 'play' button

    * Added tool for creating spline-based camera animations

    * Improve global light settings, light position can be move with the
      mouse pointer, reactivated LightMaterialPlugin in VoreenDev,

    * Rendering results are cached by default

    * Support for .dat volume files from TU Vienna
     (compare http://www.cg.tuwien.ac.at/research/vis/datasets/)

    * Improved support for Mac OS X
      o disable Render-to-Texture
      o remove lots of Mac-specific warnings
      o several GUI improvements
      o fix problem where OpenGL canvas would show garbage on startup

    * Improved DICOM support
      o direct loading of all DICOM slice in a directory (without a DICOMDIR)
      o correct behaviour for non power-of-two slices

    * Python scripts
      o benchmarking script fps.py can be started with parameter "--benchmark"
        in VoreenDev
      o new script for camera animation 
 
    * Various bugfixes and cleanups:
      o allow spaces in path names for project directory
      o VoreenDev now uses the SingleVolumeRaycaster by default
      o verify correct working directory when starting
      o better exception handling for file IO
      o fix rendering artifacts in EEP with GeForce 8 or newer
      o improve logging of GLSL compiler and linker messages
      o move all handling of interaction mode into CoarsenessRenderer
      o rework caching of processor outputs
      o update file loading progress less often
      o check for require Qt version in qmake script
      o reworked command line parser
      o fix processor names in GUI
      o handle errors during processor initialization more gracefully
      o remove black border in interaction mode


2008-11-14: Snapshot r3 (voreen-5112)
-------------------------------------
    * New SingleVolumeRaycaster, a modular default renderer:
      o compositing modes: DVR, MIP, isosurface, first-hit point, first-hit normal
      o shading: none, Phong (several variants), toon shading
      o gradient calculation: forward/central differences, filtered
      o supports different compositing modes on its three output ports
      o see network "standard.vnw" for an example
    * Multiplanar slice renderer, see network "multiplanar.vnw".
    * Example network for clipping widgets with two renderers in "clipping.vnw".
    * Simple example programm for using Voreen with GLUT in "apps/glutexample"
      (also see the tutorial on http://www.voreen.org).

    * User interface:
      o dock/undock the preview window by double clicking (VoreenVE)
      o improvements for editing multiple transfer functions
      o load networks with drag and drop (VoreenVE)
      o save state of toolbar and dock widgets (VoreenVE)
      o information about loaded data sets is serialized into the .vnw file
      o more command line parameters for voreenve and voreendev

    * Rendering / volume handling :
      o correct rendering when camera enters the volume
      o hardware volumes (OpenGL textures) are now generated implicitly when
        accessing getVolumeGL()
      o automatic downsampling of volume texture if it is larger than GPU memory
        (available memory must be specified in VolumeGL::setAvailableGpuMemory())
      o OpenGL state is checked after every process() call in
        NetworkEvaluator.

    * More detailed logging of system information, also written to a log file by
      default (you may need to add "DEFINES += VRN_ADD_FILE_LOGGER" to your
      "config.txt" file).
    * Renamed TransFuncIntensityKeys -> TransFuncIntensity.
    * Old "rptgui" application renamed to "voreenve".

    * Various bugfixes and cleanups:
      o fixed DICOM loading
      o do not link with unused ILUT lib (from DevIL image library).
      o texture container widget was showing junk debug messages
      o invalid GL_BLEND and glClearColor state changes
      o automatic registration for Processors
      o serialization of Processor::getName()
      o no more warnings with gcc
      o serialization of BackgroundProcessor in voreendev
      o adapt to coding guidelines
