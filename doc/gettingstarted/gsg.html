<h1>VoreenVE - Getting Started</h1>

<p>
  VoreenVE (Voreen Visualization Environment) is a tool to construct processor
  networks for Voreen with an easy to use graphical user interface. It allows to
  create complex rendering networks by simply dragging the desired processors
  into the workspace with the mouse and linking them by drawing the required
  connections. The networks can be tested immediately to visualize volume data
  sets.

<h2>Main Window</h2>

<p>The following window appears when starting the VoreenVE application:</p>
<br>
<img src="images/image_numbers.png" alt="main window">

<ul>

  <li>The green numbers indicate the main components:
	
    <ol>

	<li>The <i>network editor</i> shows the current processor network and allows the user to modify it interactively.</li>

	<li>The <i>visualization window</i> shows the result produced by the current network (you need to press the evaluate button <img src="images/eval.jpg"> to start rendering).</li>

	<li>The <i>processors list</i> shows all available processors. These can be used to construct networks.</li>

	<li>The <i>properties</i> allow configuration of the selected processor.</li>

    </ol>

  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Modes</h3>

<p>
VoreenVE can be used in <i>network mode</i> and <i>visualization mode</i>.
Rendering networks are constructed in network mode. Switching to
visualization mode hides the network editor and displays a larger
visualization window. While the layout of the rendering network cannot be
changed in visualization mode, it is still possible to modify
properties of the processors in the network.
</p>

<p>The same network in visualization mode looks like this:</p>

<h2>Toolbar</h2>

<p>The picture below shows the toolbar entries and their function.</p>

</ul>

<h3>Networks and Workspaces</h3>

<p>
VoreenVE can save and load networks and workspaces. <i>Networks</i> contain the
current rendering network, including all properties. <i>Workspaces</i> contain
additional information such as the loaded volume data sets.
</p>

<a name="scene"></a>
<h2>Network Editor</h2>

<h3>Processors</h3>

<p>This image shows how a processor is visualized in VoreenVE:</p>
<br>
<img src="images/processor.png">

<p>A processor can have several kinds of ports: inports are located on the upper
side of each processor item, outports are found on the lower side, and
coprocessor ports are placed on the left. 
</p>

<h3>Creating Render Networks</h3>

<p>In the network editor the graphical representation of the current network is
shown. In order to build a rendering network, you can simply add new processors
by dragging them from the processor list into the network editor. Processor can
be connected via their different ports, however the port types have to match
(different types are identifiable by their colors).
</p>

<p>Ports are connected by pressing the left mouse button over an outport
(located on the lower side of a processor) and dragging the appearing arrow to
an inport (on the upper side of a processor). The arrow indicates whether a
connection to the inport at the current mouse position is possible or not by
changing its color to green respective red. Releasing the mouse button over a
valid inport (green arrow) creates a connection.
</p>


<h3>Working with Networks</h3>

<p>In the following described how a network can be modified by the user.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>An item it <b>selected</b> by simply clicking it. Multiple items can be selected by holding the <i>CTRL</i> key
	and selecting another one or by spanning a rectangle over the items
	using the left mouse button.</li>

  <li>An item can be <b>moved</b> by clicking on it, moving it to the desired position and releasing the mouse button.</li>

  <li><b>Renaming</b> a processor or an aggregation can be done using the context menu.</li>

  <li>Items can be <b>deleted</b> by selecting them and either using the delete entry from the context menu or just pressing the <i>DEL</i> key.</li>

  <li>The workspace can be <b>zoomed</b> in and out via the mouse wheel or by using the <i>+</i> and <i>-</i> keys.</li>

</ul>

<p>
After building a network you can start it by <i>evaluating</i> it pressing <img src="images/eval.jpg" alt="the evaluate button">
in the toolbar. If no error occurs, an output image is rendered and
displayed in the visualization window.
</p>

<p>
For connection that handle image data, the intermediate result can be shown by
hovering the mouse of the connection arrow until a tooltip appears:
</p>

<a name="output"></a>
<h2>Visualization Window</h2>

<p>
After setting up a valid network you can start it by clicking on the toolbar
item <img src="images/eval.jpg" alt="evaluate button">. The output of the
network is then rendered in the visualization window. You can rotate the
camera by moving the mouse in the window while pressing the left mouse
button. Using the mouse wheel or moving the mouse up and down while pressing the
right mouse button, zooms the visualization. Pressing <i>SHIFT</i> and the left
button moves the scene.
</p>
<br>

<a name="properties"></a>
<h2>Properties</h2>

<p>Properties are used to configure the selected processor. Changes become
visible immediately in the visualization window. The buttons on the right of
each property entry toggle visibility in visualization mode. For the following example,
"Active Segment", "Use Segmentation" and "Masking" are not visible in
visualization mode:
</p>
<br>

<a name="processor_list"></a>
<h2>Processor List</h2>

<p>The processor list displays all available processors that can be
used to build networks. You can search for processors by typing in the
text box at the top.
</p>
<br>
<img src="images/processors.png">

<p>
You can add processors to your network simply by dragging them from the list into the network editor.
</p>

<a name="howto_loadfiles"></a>
<h2>Loading Data Sets</h2>

<p>To load a data set simply click on "Open Data Set" in the toolbar or in the
file-menu. The data set is then added to the volume container. To render the
loaded data set select the VolumeSetSource processor in the network and change
the VolumeSet property.
</p>
<br>
<img src="images/vss_proc.png">

<a name="texture_container"></a>
<h2>Texture Container</h2>

<p>The texture container can be used to inspect intermediate rendering
results. A left-click enlarges a texture, a second click shrinks it
again. With the context menu, alpha-channels and depth buffers can be accessed.
</p>
